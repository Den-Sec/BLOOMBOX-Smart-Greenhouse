# BLOOMBOX - Smart Greenhouse

Welcome to BLOOMBOX, the next-generation smart greenhouse designed to empower plant growth through precision automation and monitoring

## Project Overview üå±

BLOOMBOX is engineered to foster a perfect environment for plants, leveraging advanced sensors and actuators to control climate, hydration, and lighting‚Äîirrespective of external weather patterns.

## Core Features üåü

- **Automated Climate Control**: Dynamic regulation of temperature and humidity with responsive fan systems.
- **Precision Irrigation**: Smart water pumps and soil moisture sensors to deliver precise hydration.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Real-time monitoring with data logging for trend analysis via an SD card.
- **Optimized Lighting**: Intelligent light management with automated growing lights for maximum yield.
- **Scheduled Operations**: RTC module for time-critical tasks ensuring consistent plant care routines.

## Enhanced Hardware Suite üõ†Ô∏è

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The powerhouse of BLOOMBOX, orchestrating all tasks seamlessly.
- **DHT11 & MLX90614 Sensors**: Dual sensor setup for humidity and ambient temperature readings.
- **Soil & Water Sensors**: For vigilant monitoring of moisture levels and reservoir status.
- **Automated Water Pump**: Ensures your plants are watered just right, without waste.
- **SD Card & RTC Modules**: For meticulous record-keeping and precise time management.
- **Relay Modules**: The digital switchboard for your fans, pumps, and lights.
- **Fans & Growing Light**: A breath of fresh air and a spectrum of light to simulate natural conditions.
- **Power Supply**: Robust energy source designed for uninterrupted greenhouse operations.
