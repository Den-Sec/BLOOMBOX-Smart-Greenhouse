## Quickstart Guide üöÄ

Begin your BLOOMBOX journey with these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. This will give you access to all necessary files for your BLOOMBOX setup.

2. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Navigate to the `/hardware/schematics` folder within the cloned repository.
   - Follow the provided schematics to assemble your hardware components accurately. This foundational step is crucial for the functionality of your BLOOMBOX.

3. **Enclosure Assembly**:
   - Proceed to the /hardware/enclosure folder for guidance on assembling your greenhouse enclosure.
   - Follow the detailed designs to construct the enclosure that will house your BLOOMBOX setup, ensuring a stable and protective environment for your plants.

4. **Code Deployment**:
   - Find your way to the /src directory, where the source code resides.
   - Deploy this code onto your microcontroller, which is the brain behind the greenhouse's automated functions. This step brings your BLOOMBOX to life.

5. **Smart Greenhouse Activation**:
   - Double-check all connections and configurations to ensure everything is set up correctly.
   - Power on your microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) and allow it a moment to initialize. This action activates your smart greenhouse system.
     
6. **Initialize your device**:
   - Use your smartphone to connect to the Wi-Fi access point named "BLOOMBOX-AP". This network is created by your BLOOMBOX device to facilitate initial setup.
   - Once connected, you will be automatically redirected to a setup portal. If the redirection does not happen automatically, open a web browser and navigate to a default IP address provided in the documentation (e.g., 192.168.4.1).
   - Follow the on-screen instructions within the portal to connect your BLOOMBOX to your home Wi-Fi network. This step ensures your device can communicate with the internet and access the server.
   - After establishing a Wi-Fi connection, your device will be prompted to enstablish a connection to the server. This will enable your BLOOMBOX to send and receive data securely.
   - Lastly, set up the relationship between your user account and the device. This may involve entering a device ID or scanning a QR code provided by your BLOOMBOX, then linking it to your user account on the BLOOMBOX platform. This step is crucial for accessing your personalized data and insights through the dashboard.

7. **Plant Configuration**:
   - Configure your BLOOMBOX to meet the specific needs of your plant by selecting the appropriate configuration file. BLOOMBOX supports a wide variety of plants, each with unique requirements for optimal growth. Our extensive library contains thousands of pre-defined configuration files, ensuring that you can find the perfect match for your plant. If your plant has specific needs not covered by our existing configurations, BLOOMBOX also offers the flexibility to create and upload a custom configuration file..
   - To upload the chosen configuration file to your device, connect to the BLOOMBOX interface through your preferred method (Web interface, or directly uploading to the SD card). Navigate to the 'Plant Configuration' section and select the option to upload a new configuration file. Once uploaded, BLOOMBOX will automatically adjust its settings to align with the requirements specified in the configuration file, ensuring your plant receives the precise care it needs for optimal growth.

Happy gardening!
